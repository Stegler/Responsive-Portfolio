                I was born in Wurtzberg, Germany on October 5th 1991. Moved to Korea and lived there until I was in 5th
                grade. I then moved to Olympia, Washington and have lived there ever since.
                I am a younger brother to a loving older sister named Sarah. I played the trumpet and tenor saxophone
                throughout middle school and high school. I also enjoyed playing tennis throughout high school. Decided to
                go to college at Central Washington and graduated with a BS in Biology and minor in Chemistry.
                I did not end up working in that field which brings me to the UW BootCamp class which I could not be more
                excited for.

                Some of the things I enjoy in my spare time are staying active and riding my bike when the weather is nice.
                On lazy Sunday's I may sit down to play some online video games although I don't imagine having very many of those
                days while taking this BootCamp course. Besides coding I am currently learning how to cook because who
                enjoys eating the same meals over and over again. One day I hope to work with a development team on mobile app devlopment
                or even video game devlopment. Only time will tell.
